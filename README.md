# 19th-Century-Mod

This project strives to create a ruleset for souly the long XIX century period, from the Napoleonic wars, to the start of WW1.

Inspired on Paradox's Victoria II game, I hope to build a realistic experience in Unciv, with exiting combat, and interactive development. And yes, colonization.
